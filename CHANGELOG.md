## 2.2.0 (2026-10-23): smarter rater, visual report, self-improvement loop

Findings from a self-audit of theagencyzero.com, python.org, and example.com, and what changed:

| Miss found in self-audit | Fix |
|---|---|
| Performance was blank whenever PageSpeed's free quota ran out | Estimated performance proxy (render-blocking scripts, stylesheets, HTML weight, image sizing, modern formats), labeled INFERRED, used only when PageSpeed is unavailable |
| Didn't notice http:// serving the site without redirecting (duplicate host) | New check: http and www/non-www variants must redirect to one canonical https host |
| Soft 404s went undetected | New check: a random URL must return 404/410 |
| No canonical-tag check in the rating | New check |
| Social check ignored og:description; tips had no copy-paste help | Social cards check covers og:title, og:description, and og:image, plus a filled-in tag kit |
| Contact details not checked for GEO | New check: tel:/mailto: link or schema telephone/email |
| Heading check missed pages starting at H3 | Now flags "start→H3" |
| Tips were generic | Fix kits: current titles and descriptions with lengths, starter Organization JSON-LD, sameAs block, robots groups, sitemap command (all facts as [CONFIRM]) |
| Plain-text report only; leaked temp file paths in chat | Visual `report.html` (score rings, category bars, ranked fix cards, page-by-page table, collapsible checks); the skill no longer prints temp paths |
| No regression protection | Offline fixture tests (good vs bad site), `scripts/dev/benchmark.py`, and a CONTRIBUTING self-improvement loop |

Also: the MCP server folder moved from `mcp/` to `mcp-server/`, so it no longer shadows the `mcp` Python package during test discovery. If you registered the server by path, update it.

Rubric version 2.0. Scores aren't comparable with 1.x: new checks were added, and GEO weights were rebalanced (Bing access 10→5, new contact-details check worth 5).
